# MySQL:

Type:
    varchar(size)
    char(size)
    numeric(n, dec)/ intefer/ double/ decimal
    date
    datetime

MySQL uses DBO(DataBase Object) engine.


SQL Commands:
    To create Database:
        create database databaseName;
    To use database:
        use databaseName;
    To show existing databases:
        show databases;
    To show existing tables in a database:
        show tables;
    To create Table:
        create table <table_name> (<colname> <type> (size) [primary key], <colname> <type>(size) ____);
    To insert values in a table:
        insert into tableName values (these values will be in the same order as the columns. varchar, char, date will be in single quotes.)
    To insert into specified columns only:
        insert into tablename 
    
Connect to database from a python script:
    conn = sql.connect(host = 'localhost', port = 3306, user = 'root', password = '12345678', db = 'Practice')
    Here conn is a arbitary variable which holds the query of reference to the database.

    cmd = conn.cursor()
    Here cursor is a function which is used to create command object which is used to supply sql quries to database engine.
    cmd is a arbitary variable.

    row = cmd.fetchall()        will form a list of the data
    

Group Functions:
    Sum()
    Avg()
    min()
    max()
    count()

Select Statement:
    select * / <colname> from <tableName> 
    [where <condition>] 
    [where <colname> [NOT] like %]
    [where <colname> [NOT] in (v1, v2, v3)]
    [where <colname> [NOT] between v1 and v2]
    [order by [DESC] <colname1, 2,....>]
    [group by <colname1, 2,.....> having <condition>]
    eg.
        select * from tablename     //show complete table
        select ProductID, ProductName from tableName        //show only 2 specified columns 
        select * from tableName where ProductID = 7         //show all columns where ProductID = 7
        select * from tableName where ProductName = 'L'     //show all columns where ProductID = 'L'
        select * from tableName where price >= 1000 and price <= 100000
        select * from tableName where ProductPrice > 10000 and ProductDate > '2017-02-02'
        select * from tableName where ProductName like 'a%'         //show all columns where ProductName starts with 'a'
        select * from tableName where ProductName like '%ing%'      //show all columns where ProductName has the string 'ing'
        select * from tableName where city not like '%pur'      //show all columns where city doesnot end with pur
        select * from tableName where city like '___'       //will show where city has 3 or less characters
        select * from tableName where city like '_a%'       //will show where city has 2nd character 'a'
        select * from tableName where city like '__UN'      //will show where city has 4 or less characters and ends with 'UN'
        select salary, salary*50/100 as DA, salary*16/100 as HRA from tableName
        select * from Customer whose city in ('Mumbai', 'Gwalior')
        select * from Customer where amountpaid between 10000 and 500000
                                    or
                                where amountpaid >= 10000 and amountpaid < 500000
        select department from Employee group by department         //doesnot show duplicate entries
        select Sum(salary), min(salary), max(salary), count(*), department from employee group by department
        select EmployeeName from employee order by EmployeeName         //show in ascending order
        select EmployeeName from employee order by EmployeeName desc        //show in descending order

Delete Statement:
    delete from <tableName>
    [where <condition>]
    [where <colname> [NOT] like '%_']
    [where <colname> [NOT] between v1 and v2]
    [where <colname> [NOT] in (v1, v2,......)]

Update Statement:
    update tableName set <colname> = value, <colname> = value .....
    [where <condition>]
    [where [NOT] [like] [in] [between]]
    eg.
        update product set productPrice = productprice - (productprice*40/100) where productid = 7
