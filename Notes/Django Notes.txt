Django
Used for web development
Use MVC design pattern (Model View Control)

Controller: views.py
Mapping: urls.py

Cycle: Browser -> url -> view -> webpage -> Browser

Initial WorkFlow:
    Initials:
        Terminal: $django-admin startproject project_name       //start the project and create its files
        Terminal: cd project_directory
        Terminal: python3 manage.py runserever      //to start the server
    views.py
        Create a file named views.py inside 'BASE_DIR->project_name'
        Open the required libraries and create required functions (actions)
    urls.py
        Now import views in url.py and create urls for actions
        For templates, create a folder named templates in BASE_DIR. This folder will contain all the web pages or scripts.
    settings.py
        Go to settings.py to include templates folder in the project
    templates
        Work with the templates inside action definations in views.py
        In a HTML file, within the form tag, specify the target function from views.py under the attribute action 
        Modify the HTML and views.py relatively
    Miscellneous
        Change the TIME_ZONE to 'Asia/Kolkata' in settings.py
        Errors can be checked live in the terminal/cmd

views.py: 
    This file is created manually.
    This file contains all the functions (actions).
    This file uses a function which can render url calls
        from django.http import HttpResponse      //it is used to directly used to send HTML contents in its argument
        from django.shortcuts import render     //it is used to render HTML files from templates folder
    HttpResponse: this object is used to send the response to client in the form of text and html.
    Syntax for a action defination:
        def action_name(request):

url.py:
    First import your views.py as follows:
        from . import views
    This is used to call actions from views.py and map them. 
    Inside urlpatterns, url path to all the actions are linked.

templates:
    This folder is created manually.
    It contains all the webpages and scripts which are to be rendered.
    Inside the HTML file, under the form tag in its attribute action, link the function from views.py as below:
        <form action = '/func_name'>

Adding other resources:
    Create a folder named asset in BASE_DIR.
    Go to settings.py and at the end of the file, add:
    STATICFILES_DIRS = (                            //links the asset folder to static
        os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "asset"),
    )
    Go to urls.py and at the end of the file, add:
        urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns()        //
    Import the following in urls.py:
        from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import staticfiles_urlpatterns     //
